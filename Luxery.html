<p>Luxury cars are high-end vehicles that offer premium features, advanced technologies, and exceptional comfort. They are designed to provide an exclusive and refined driving experience, with top-notch materials and craftsmanship, spacious interiors, and impressive performance. Some common features of luxury cars include leather or suede upholstery, wood or metal accents, heated and cooled seats, premium audio systems, advanced safety features, and cutting-edge infotainment systems.

    Luxury car brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Jaguar, Land Rover, Porsche, and many others. These cars typically come with a high price tag, but for those who are willing to pay for the ultimate driving experience, luxury cars are an excellent choice.</p>
